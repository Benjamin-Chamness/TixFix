# TixFix
Red Badge Project:

by Benjamin Chamness

TixFix is a simple MVC utilizing N-tier architecture to allow customers to view or post tickets for upcoming Cincinnati Reds baseball games.  I chose this because it allowed me to be very specific when creating my MVP, but also allowed a ton of room to expand to allow other teams games to be viewed as well as completing a transaction function to make the app complete. I look forward to expanding this project in the future to see how it depth in can go.
